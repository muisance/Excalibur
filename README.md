## Getting Started

### .env file

Create an `.env` file and fill in
your infura API key and the private key
of the account which will send the deployment transaction

```environemnt
INFURA_KEY=123456XXXXXX
PRIVATE_KEY=123456XXXXXX
ETHERSCAN_API_KEY=123456XXXXXX
```

### Some Basic Commands

-   Install environemnt:
    `npm install`
-   Run tests:
    `npx hardhat test`
-   Check contract size:
    `npx hardhat size-contracts`
-   Deploy (to rinkeby):
    `npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.ts --network rinkeby`
-   Deploy (to boba_mainnet):
    `npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.ts --network boba_mainnet`
-   Compile contracts:
    `npx hardhat compile`
-   Cleanup:
    `npx hardhat clean`

### Etherscan verification

Enter your Etherscan API key into the .env file
and run the following command
(replace `DEPLOYED_CONTRACT_ADDRESS`
with the contract's address and "Hello, Hardhat!"
with the parameters you sent the contract upon deployment):

```shell
npx hardhat verify \
    --network boba_mainnet \
    DEPLOYED_CONTRACT_ADDRESS \
    "Hello, Hardhat!"
```
